Orginal Xbox Front button board. 
Three options are uploaded.
1. Has the HDD and LAN leds added to it with locations to add resistors. These are 0603 SMD's 
2. Is same as stock with the Tracks on the back.
3. Same as stock but with the layers swapped so the tracks are on the front for if you are worried about tracks getting exposed and shorting things out.

I'm considering doing a drawing to have self adhesive vinyl cut. This is to be affixed to the back so that it is the same as stock. 
I have not found a suitable suplier yet. 
I will probably use 50mm wide PVC tape on the back of mine and then cut it out with craft knife or exacto blade
