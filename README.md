Orginal Xbox Front button board. 
Recreated in KiCad based off the Board design of the Gerbers from Thomas Heath
Track Layout redesigned to be almost the same as stock on the back.
All graphics replaced and outline adjusted with curves.

Three options are uploaded.
1. Has the HDD and LAN leds added to it with locations to add resistors. These are 0603 SMD's 
2. Is same as stock with the Tracks on the back.
3. Same as stock but with the layers swapped so the tracks are on the front for if you are worried about tracks getting exposed and shorting things out.

I've done a drawing to make a self adhesive vinyl sticker. This is to be affixed to the back so that it is the same as stock. 
I have not found a suitable suplier yet. 

if I cannot get stickers I will probably use 50mm wide PVC tape on the back of mine and then cut it out with a craft knife or exacto blade

These Tactile switches have the correct measurements.

I bought some of these off ali express. You could solder them on directly or use another suitable connector.
